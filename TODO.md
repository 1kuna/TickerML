- 🔍 **UNVERIFIED** - Status unclear, needs investigation

---

## 🏗️ PHASE 1: Data Infrastructure Upgrade (Weeks 1-4)

### **🎯 Goal: Transform from basic OHLCV to institutional-grade market data**

### 1.1 **WebSocket-Based Collection** (Week 1)
- [x] **Replace REST with WebSockets** - Eliminate polling delays
- [x] **Order Book L2/L3 Collection** - Top 20-50 levels with microsecond timestamps (incremental updates working)
- [x] **Trade Stream Integration** - Individual trade data (price, volume, side)
- [x] **Event Synchronization** - Critical: Order books and trades arrive separately, must replay in timestamp order
- [x] **Data Validation Layer** - Gap detection and quality checks

**New Files Required:**
- [x] `raspberry_pi/orderbook_collector.py` - WebSocket L2/L3 collection ✅ CREATED
- [x] `raspberry_pi/trade_stream.py` - Real-time trade data ✅ CREATED
- [x] `raspberry_pi/data_validator.py` - Quality checks and gap detection ✅ CREATED
- [x] `raspberry_pi/event_synchronizer.py` - Event synchronization system ✅ CREATED

### 1.2 **Funding Rate Monitoring** (Week 1) ⚠️ CRITICAL
- [x] **Perpetuals Funding Tracker** - Rates can be up to 1% daily!
- [x] **Cost Calculation Engine** - Hidden cost that kills profits
- [x] **Timing Optimization** - Rates reset every 8 hours (00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC)

**New File:**
- [x] `raspberry_pi/funding_monitor.py` - Track funding rates across exchanges ✅ CREATED

### 1.3 **Event-Driven Architecture** (Week 2)
- ❌ **Kafka Cluster Setup** - Single-node for home use (config exists, deployment pending)
- ❌ **Replace Cron Jobs** - Event-driven processing
- ❌ **Kafka Producers** - Data collectors
- ❌ **Kafka Consumers** - Processing pipeline
- ❌ **Stream Processing** - Real-time data flow

**Configuration Files:**
- `config/kafka_config.yaml` ⚠️ VERIFY: Config file exists but Kafka not deployed
- Kafka topics: crypto-orderbooks, crypto-trades, trading-signals

### 1.4 **TimescaleDB Migration** (Week 3-4)
- ❌ **Migrate from SQLite** - Production-grade time-series database (config exists, still using SQLite)
- ❌ **Hypertable Creation** - Time-series optimization
- ❌ **Storage Strategy** - Hot (7d NVMe) → Warm (3m compressed) → Cold (archive)
- ❌ **Schema Design** - Order books with JSONB for bids/asks ⚠️ VERIFY: Schema designed but not deployed

**New Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE order_books (
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    exchange VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    symbol VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    bids JSONB NOT NULL,
    asks JSONB NOT NULL,
    mid_price NUMERIC(20,8),
    spread NUMERIC(20,8)
);
```

---

## 🤖 PHASE 2: Paper Trading Engine (Weeks 5-8)

### **🎯 Goal: Build production-grade portfolio management with realistic execution**

### 2.1 **Portfolio Management System** (Week 5)
- [x] **Core Trading Engine** - `raspberry_pi/paper_trader.py` ✅ CREATED
- [x] **Virtual Portfolio** - $10,000 starting balance
- [x] **Position Tracking** - Real-time portfolio state
- [x] **Performance Metrics** - P&L, Sharpe ratio, drawdown
- [x] **Database Integration** - Portfolio state persistence

**Database Tables:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE portfolio_state (
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ PRIMARY KEY,
    cash_balance NUMERIC(20,8),
    total_value NUMERIC(20,8),
    positions JSONB,
    daily_pnl NUMERIC(20,8),
    max_drawdown NUMERIC(10,4)
);
```

### 2.2 **Execution Simulation** (Week 6) ⚠️ CRITICAL REALISM
- 🚧 **Queue Position Modeling** - FIFO assumption, track cumulative volume
  - ✅ Basic slippage simulation (0.05% fixed rate)
  - ❌ FIFO queue position tracking
  - ❌ Cumulative volume analysis  
  - ❌ Toxic fill detection (queue position >10)
  - ❌ Order book depth-based execution
- 🚧 **Latency Simulation** - Exchange-specific delays (50-200ms)
  - ✅ Basic delay concept in place
  - ❌ Exchange-specific latency modeling
  - ❌ Network condition simulation
- ❌ **Partial Fills** - Realistic order execution
  - ✅ OrderStatus.PARTIALLY_FILLED enum defined
  - ❌ Partial fill execution logic
  - ❌ Progressive fill simulation
- ✅ **Market Impact** - Your orders affect prices (basic slippage model)
- ✅ **Slippage Calculation** - Based on order book depth (simplified percentage model)

**Implementation Note:**
- ⚠️ `execution_sim.py` - Functionality integrated into `paper_trader.py` instead of separate file
- ⚠️ Current implementation uses basic slippage rather than sophisticated queue modeling

**Key Insight:** Queue position >10 = likely toxic fill (adverse selection)

### 2.3 **Risk Management Layer** (Week 7-8)
- ✅ **Position Sizing** - Fractional Kelly criterion (0.25x multiplier)
  - ✅ Max 25% portfolio per position implemented
  - ✅ Signal strength scaling (0.0-1.0)
  - ✅ Minimum order size validation ($10)
- ✅ **Drawdown Control** - Maximum 25% portfolio loss
  - ✅ Real-time drawdown monitoring
  - ✅ High water mark tracking
  - ✅ Emergency position closure on max drawdown
- ❌ **Correlation Limits** - Prevent concentrated risk
  - ❌ Cross-asset correlation analysis
  - ❌ Portfolio concentration limits
  - ❌ Sector/theme exposure controls
- ✅ **Circuit Breakers** - Auto-stop on anomalous conditions
  - ✅ Maximum drawdown circuit breaker (25%)
  - ✅ Individual position stop-loss (5%)
  - ✅ Take-profit automation (10%)
- ✅ **Risk-Adjusted Rewards** - Sharpe-based, not raw P&L
  - ✅ Real-time Sharpe ratio calculation
  - ✅ Annualized return metrics
  - ✅ Win rate tracking

**Implementation Note:**
- ⚠️ `risk_manager.py` - Functionality integrated into `paper_trader.py` instead of separate file
- ⚠️ Correlation analysis not implemented - single-asset risk only

**Critical Formula:** 
```python
# Fractional Kelly for position sizing
kelly_fraction = 0.25  # NEVER use full Kelly (too aggressive)
position_size = portfolio_value * 0.02 * signal_strength * kelly_fraction
```

**Feature Priority (by predictive power):**
1. Order book imbalance (highest <1min)
2. Trade flow imbalance (momentum)
3. Microprice vs mid deviation (fair value)
4. Cross-exchange spreads (arbitrage)
5. VWAP deviation (mean reversion)

### 3.3 **Offline RL Training** (Week 12)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTITUTIONAL INSIGHTS (DO NOT IGNORE)

### **🚨 The 30-Day Quarantine Rule**
- **NEVER train on data from the last 30 days**
- **This includes hyperparameter tuning**
- **Violation = guaranteed overfitting**

### **🔒 Frozen Backbone is Mandatory**
- **Pre-trained encoder must stay frozen**
- **Only train action/value heads**
- **Weekly refresh of outer layers only**

### **⏱️ Event Synchronization**
- **Order books and trades arrive separately**
- **Wrong ordering = false patterns**
- **Use event log replay, not naive joining**

### **📈 Paper Trading ≠ Training Data**
- **Paper trading validates only**
- **Never update weights from paper results**
- **It's a test set, not training set**

### **🎯 Execution Realism**
- **Queue position >10 = likely toxic fill**
- **Your latency = 10-100x institutional**
- **Always model adverse selection**

### **💰 Hidden Costs Kill Profits**
- **Funding rates (up to 1% daily!)**
- **Maker/taker fee differences**
- **Spread widening during volatility**
- **Your own market impact**

### **🔢 BF16 > FP16 for Finance**
- **FP16 can overflow with price data**
- **BF16 has FP32's range**
- **Critical for numerical stability**
