## ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTITUTIONAL INSIGHTS (DO NOT IGNORE)

### **🚨 The 30-Day Quarantine Rule**
- **NEVER train on data from the last 30 days**
- **This includes hyperparameter tuning**
- **Violation = guaranteed overfitting**

### **🔒 Frozen Backbone is Mandatory**
- **Pre-trained encoder must stay frozen**
- **Only train action/value heads**
- **Weekly refresh of outer layers only**

### **⏱️ Event Synchronization**
- **Order books and trades arrive separately**
- **Wrong ordering = false patterns**
- **Use event log replay, not naive joining**

### **📈 Paper Trading ≠ Training Data**
- **Paper trading validates only**
- **Never update weights from paper results**
- **It's a test set, not training set**

### **🎯 Execution Realism**
- **Queue position >10 = likely toxic fill**
- **Your latency = 10-100x institutional**
- **Always model adverse selection**

### **💰 Hidden Costs Kill Profits**
- **Funding rates (up to 1% daily!)**
- **Maker/taker fee differences**
- **Spread widening during volatility**
- **Your own market impact**

### **🔢 BF16 > FP16 for Finance**
- **FP16 can overflow with price data**
- **BF16 has FP32's range**
- **Critical for numerical stability**

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

```bash
# 1. Fix immediate compatibility issues
# Fix Flask dashboard
sed -i 's/@app.before_first_request/@app.before_request/g' raspberry_pi/dashboard.py

# 2. Test current system
python tests/test_summary.py

# 3. Validate existing pipeline
python pc/train.py --epochs 2 --batch_size 1
python raspberry_pi/dashboard.py &
python raspberry_pi/infer.py

# 4. Begin Phase 1 planning
# Install Kafka and TimescaleDB
# Design WebSocket collectors
# Plan database migration
```

*This TODO represents a complete transformation from basic crypto price prediction to institutional-grade trading system. Each phase builds systematically toward production deployment with proper risk management and execution realism.*

**🎯 CURRENT PROGRESS SUMMARY:**
- **Phase 1 (Data Infrastructure)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Event-driven architecture with Kafka and TimescaleDB ready
- **Phase 2 (Paper Trading)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Advanced execution simulation and risk management
- **Phase 3 (Model Architecture)**: ✅ LARGELY COMPLETED - Decision Transformer implemented, offline RL pending
- **Phase 4 (Multi-Exchange)**: 🚧 PENDING - Exchange abstraction and arbitrage monitoring needed

**🚀 NEXT PRIORITY ITEMS:**
1. **Offline RL Trainer** - Implement 30-day quarantine rule (high priority)
2. **Multi-Exchange Abstraction** - Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin integration
3. **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage** - Real-time opportunity detection
4. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end system validation
5. **VPIN & Kyle's Lambda** - Advanced microstructure features
